# fluidreview-jquery
This project houses all of the jquery written on top of the General Operating Support application hosted by FluidReview. While FluidReview is a great drag-and-drop application builder, it lacks some out-of-the-box customization. The platform allows the builder to drop in a javascript box. The javascript box only applies to that application page (so, if a form has multiple pages, you'll need each page to have the javascript box dropped in). More about the javascript box here: https://fluidreview.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002494634-JavaScript-Question
